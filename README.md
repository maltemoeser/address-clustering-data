### Release of our ground truth data set

We make our ground truth data set publicly available to allow other researchers to evaluate it using their own tools and techniques.
We believe that making this data public does not create significant new privacy risks: all information necessary to recreate the data set is already publicly available on the Bitcoin blockchain and our method---extracting change outputs revealed by the multi-input heuristic---is easy to reproduce with open-source tools like BlockSci.
